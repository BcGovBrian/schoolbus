Schoolbus Inspection Tracking System User Manual
======================

Introduction
----------------

The PDF School Bus User Manual can be found in this folder.

The current version of the User Manual was created using a commercial package called [ScreenSteps](https://www.screensteps.com) - desktop version (which may not be available anymore). If you have access to that software, you can load the ScreenSteps package file (extension sstcpkg) into ScreenSteps and evolve the manual. Please make sure that when you finish your updates you export both the PDF (the User Manual itself) and the sstcpkg so that the manual can be continued to evolve.

If you do not have access to that software, you have two options:

1. You can request contributor [Stephen Curran](swcurran@gmail.com) use his licensed copy of the software to update the User Manual. No guarantees, but that might work.
2. You can break the connection between the ScreenSteps source and the generated PDF manual by loading the PDF into Microsoft Word (or some other PDF to editable form converter) and evolve the manual in Word.  If you take this approach please delete the ScreenSteps package, update this README.md file and commit both Word and PDF versions of the User Manual.  You will likely have to apply some formatting to the document in Word to get the manual looking right - perhaps even better, since you have more control over the formatting.

*Note*: ScreenSteps Desktop has evolved to be a subscription documentation hosting service, and I'm not sure it's still possible to do standalone manuals like this. As such, breaking the manual from the ScreenSteps source is not such a bad thing. ScreenSteps Desktop is definitely much easier than Word for building manuals like this, but no that the manual is more or less complete, revising it further in Word is not a bad thing.
